      "summary": "<p><b>TMZ </b>(also known simply as <i>TMZ</i> or <i>TMZTV or TMZ on TV</i>) is an American syndicated entertainment and gossip news television show that premiered on September 10, 2007. The program is generally aired on Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates (along with a few affiliates of other major networks), though a majority of the stations that carry the series are Fox affiliates. It is essentially a television version of its sister operation, TMZ.com, a news website with a heavy emphasis on gossip of celebrities' personal lives, which debuted in December 2005. The television program is produced at studio facilities that serve as the headquarters for the parent website, located at 13031 West Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. TMZ is an insider term (\"thirty-mile zone\" or studio zone), referring to the movie studio area of downtown Hollywood. On October 23, 2013, Warner Bros. Television Distribution announced that the program's charter station group, FOX Television Stations, renewed <i>TMZ on TV</i> through the 2016â€“17 season.</p>",
